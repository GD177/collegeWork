            Students of the CSE department of Bhagwan Parshura Institute of Technology, we took up this project in order to implement our knowledge and create something useful and in order to learn something new.
              While doing the project , we got to know and incorporate a lot of new things. It was a test of our knowledge which we got an opportunity to challenge.
As more and more people are getting educated, the work level is increasing due to increasing competition and hence the stress. So we developed the website for recreational purposes. The games present in the website are very casual which suffice the purpose of relaxation without being distracting. We added a budget app since the website has been developed keeping the working class in mind.  As the project involved three people, hence we got to learn a lot of new things and most of all understood the meaning of teamwork.
