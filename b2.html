              <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">How Minimum Viable Product (MVP) can Benefit Mobile App Development</h1>
            <iframe src="./img/b2.jpg" height="350" width="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" ></iframe>
              <p>From startups to Fortune 500, every company has a mind to risk management for dealing with those out of the blue scenarios. In an app development project, it’s the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that helps the businesses to evaluate and forecast the risk, so that a deliverable is rendered, which is accepted by the targeted persona.<br>

What is a Minimum Viable Product? How can it help businesses to to launch their next big idea or services through a versatile mobile app? What are the benefits associated with MVP of an app. The later segment will answer all related queries.
            <br>
                  <h3><b>What is Minimum Viable Product?</b></h3>
                  MVP is an initial version of a product, which is designed and developed to test the acceptability and ability of an idea. You can say, MVP is the base model of your product.<br>

It’s build with minimum, but core features of the product, following the standard app development cycle. This way, the team can receive a feedback, understanding how the product is perceived by the users, what are the stumbling blocks in performance, what improvements can be done to make the product impactful etc.<br>

You can launch MVP either to a set of users or released into the market to start the business. If MVP fails to impress the users, it indicates that the roadmap followed for mobile app development is wrong or the app idea needs to be revamped to impress the users.<br>

While MVP is an active, workable model of a product, a lot of people misconceptualize it with the product under different stages of development. Here is an example explaining what MVP is and what it is not.<br>
            <br>
                 
            
                 <h2><b>Benefits that you can Derive from MVP</b></h2><br>
            
            Building MVP for a scalable mobile app development project could bring in a number of advantages to the business. Here are a few of them.<br>
            
            <b>1. Test the Persona: </b>Evaluating success rate of an idea at the initial stage can save millions and let you earn billions. Launch MVP for your product idea amongst a set of users and you can evaluate the possible persona for your product.<br>

<b>2. Rate App’s Performance:</b> With MVP, you can evaluate if you are moving ahead with the right technologies. You can also test the ability of your developer in generating the expected output.<br>

<b>3. Handle Security Issues: </b>If the app have some security loopholes, you can detect and correct them, without harm to a mass. The problem when fixed at a lower level is a reputation saviour, augments retention rate, and ultimately leads to happy customers.<br>

<b>4. Analyse User Expectation:</b> Certainly, MVP will be launched with mobile app analytics tools integrated with it. This will help you to evaluate how users are using your app, what option or features they use often, what is their behaviour with the app, what are they exploring in the app using the search tab etc. Once all of these factors are analyzed, your idea will definitely get a boost.<br>

<b>5. Build Better Version of App:</b> Launching MVP of an app means you are connecting your idea with the users. The feedback thus received gives confidence in the idea, analyze user requirements, and build a product that is a sure hit in the market.<br>
